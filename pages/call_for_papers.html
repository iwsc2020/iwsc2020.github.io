<h2>14th International Workshop on Software Clones (IWSC 2020)</h2>
<h3>Co-located with <a href="https://saner2020.csd.uwo.ca/" target="_blank">the 27th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2020)</a></h3>
<h3>February 18th, 2020, London, Ontario, Canada</h3>

<p>Software clones are often a result of copying and pasting as an act of
ad-hoc reuse by programmers, and can occur at many levels, from simple
statement sequences to blocks, methods, classes, source files,
subsystems, models, architectures and entire designs, and in all
software artifacts (code, models, requirements or architecture
documentation, etc.). Software clone research is of high relevance for
software engineering research and practice today.
</p>

<p>
IWSC series of events has provided a common forum for this important
research area as it continues to grow in application breadth and
technical depth. IWSC aims to bring researchers and practitioners to
evaluate the current state of research, discuss common problems and
emerging directions. Also, we are interested in discussing and spreading
practical applications of clone technologies.
Further details about IWSC 2020
are here on this website (<a href="https://iwsc2020.github.io" target="_blank">https://iwsc2020.github.io</a>).
</p>

<h3>TOPICS OF INTEREST:</h3>
<p>
Topics of interest include but not restricted to the following aspects of software clone research:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Techniques and studies of code clone search, detection, analysis, and management
<li>Industrial experience with clones and clone management
<li>Use cases for clones and clone management in the software lifecycle
<li>Similarity measures of source code and other development artifacts
<li>Clone detection across multiple programming languages
<li>Clone detection applied to non-source code artifacts
<li>Source code clone detection supported by other development artifacts
<li>Clone typologies: kinds, cause and effects, management strategies, etc.
<li>Visualization of clones
<li>Clone evolution and approaches to managing variation
<li>Clone analysis in families of similar systems and software product lines
<li>Economic and trade-off models for clone management
<li>Effects of clones on system complexity and quality
<li>Software licensing and plagiarism issues
<li>Evaluation and benchmarking of clone detection methods
<li>Clone refactoring techniques and studies
<li>System architecture and clones
<li>Higher-level clones in models and designs
<li>Clone-aware software design and development
<li>Security implications of software code cloning
<li>Other applications of clone detection and analysis techniques
</ul>

<h3>Papers</h3>

<p>The following types of papers are sought:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full papers (7 pages maximum) are expected to present novel research ideas
and open issues, significant empirical studies, or important viewpoints of
the field.

<li>Position papers (2 pages maximum) should raise new ideas and issues or
describe early research achievements, emphasizing originality and potential
to stimulate active discussion at the workshop.

<li>Tool demonstration papers (4 pages maximum) should describe clone-related
tools and their applications.
</ul>

<p>All types of papers will be formally reviewed by at least three members of
the program committee. Submissions should be relevant to the goals of the
workshop and hold potential for lively discussion and debate.</p>
